# giSAR
A Quantum GIS tool used to simplify import of InSAR time series processing results (e.g. StaMPS, SARPROZ). The tool is aiming to combine other various QGIS toolboxes useful for InSAR visualization and post-processing purposes.

Development of this tool was supported by the European Fund for Regional Progress - FEDER (Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento
Regional) through the project BI/COMPETE/38732/UTAD/2014 entitled “RemotWatch – Alert and Monitoring System for Physical Structures” and by The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports from the National Programme of Sustainability (NPU II) project „IT4Innovations excellence in science - LQ1602“.
